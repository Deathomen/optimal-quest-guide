# Optimal Quest Guide
The Oldschool Wiki contains a great [Optimal Quest Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) to help you keep track of quests and complete them in order. The issue is that I play Runescape on multiple computers and don't want to spend the time to check off all the quests I  have completed. Along with this is the random quests that I do which mess up the quest order. 

## Usage

- Plugin auto updates on quest completion.
- Right clicking a quest and select "Open Wiki Guide" to open the wiki page for the quest.
- Quests display the skill, quest point and combat level requirements for them.
    - If any of these are wrong they need to be updated on [this wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quests/Skill_requirements).
    - The icon that looks like: ![(c)](https://github.com/cesoun/optimal-quest-guide/blob/master/src/main/resources/combat_level.png?raw=true) represents the required combat level.
