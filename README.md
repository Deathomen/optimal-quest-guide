# Optimal Quest Guide
The Oldschool Wiki contains a great [Optimal Quest Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) to help you keep track of quests and complete them in order. The issue is that I play Runescape on multiple computers and don't want to spend the time to check off all the quests I  have completed. Along with this is the random quests that I do which mess up the quest order. 

## Usage

- Plugin auto updates on quest completion.
- Right clicking a quest and select "Open Wiki Guide" to open the wiki page for the quest.
- Quests display the skill, quest point and combat level requirements for them.
    
## Bugs

If you happen to run into one please open and issue here or send me a message on Discord. I wrote most of this during weird hours of the morning.

If any of the quests are missing skill requirements they need to be updated on [this wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quests/Skill_requirements). 
That page is where I pull all the quest requirement info from and helps in the future.

The Ironman Mode guide is using [this wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide/Ironman) which is unfinished at the moment.
There will likely be missing content.
